# Contacts - iOS

**Contacts** is yet another contact sample app made to learn better the clean swift architecture.

---

**UPDATE** as March 26, 2021, just the same day I started this sample project, I've decided to discontinue this, perhaps for now.
I realized I'm wasting a bit time trying to do this project and my main full-time project back and forth.
I haven't learned Clean Swift architecture fully. I've decided to just learn such architecture through my main project.
Since they're practically the same structure and setup, except the project name.

## Tech Stacks


The project was built using **Xcode 12.3**, **Swift 5.3.2**.
Persistence of data is handled using Core Data.

Dependencies are managed by [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/).

[Clean-swift](http://clean-swift.com/) is the architectural pattern used together with [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift).

NodeJS backend will be deployed on to Heroku.

**Unit Testing** is powered by Quick and Nimble.
**UI Tests** use Apple's vanilla **XCUITest** test framework.
